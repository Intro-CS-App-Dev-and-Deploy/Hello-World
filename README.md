# Hello-World
A first program in Processing-JAVA

Ideas to learn
- Define static programming
- Different parts of Processing IDE(color coded lines of code, debugger line, console, then dropdown menus)
- Initiating Variables and Population on same line
- Concatenation
- Use of Character Escapes
- Differences between the following variable types: `char`, `String`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`
- Viewing a Variable & Viewing the Return of a Formula
- Introduces dynamic programming with skip counting
- Bonus Question: why is String capitalized? (Answer introduces coding method in advanced computer science)

### Different Character Escapes
- See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html

# To Include

Purpose of console:
- look inside program's progress of executable lines, variables
- if returns or values are not what expected, then changes needed

Questions
- How many different ways of concatenation are illustrated?
- Describe different ways of naming variables.

Semi-colons separate executable functions for compiler - difficult for human reading so we also use white space

Functions are BLUE when spelt correctly

Single Line and Multiple line comments
- Also handles human reading

Assignment to include
- Simple arithmetic formulae
- Demo Pascal's Triangle (2^x) as data structure
- Demo Modulus as way of determining even-odd (value of numerator in fraction, introduces geometry and ratios)
